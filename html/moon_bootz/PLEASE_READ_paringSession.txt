Hi!

My pairing partner, Nick Davidson, has been ill this week which has prevented us from completing the assignment before the week 2 deadline. We are planning on completing this assignment together as soon as Nick is feeling better. 

Sarah has already demonstrated knowledge related to this assignment (relative paths and adding images) in the subsequent solo assignments - https://github.com/sarahsucha/sarahsucha.github.io 

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us:
