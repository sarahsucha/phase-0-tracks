### What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
Linux is a direct descendant of Unix. There is no standardized statement of the philosophy, but it is essentially about modularity, e.g. a system of components which can be fit together in a variety of ways.

#### 9 Major Tenets
Apparently these 9 major tenets come from the book *Linux and the Unix Philosophy* from Mike Gancarz
1. Small is Beautiful
2. Each Program does One Thing Well
3. Prototype as Soon as Possible
4. Choose Portability over Efficiency
5. Store Data in Flat Text Files
6. User Software Leverage
7. Use Shell Scrips to Increase Leverage and Portability
8. Avoid Captive User Interfaces
9. Make Every Program a Filter

#### Oregon State Summary:
* The user should know better... so s/he must specify how things work
* Provide mechanisms, not policy
* It's not friendly, but it's efficient
* Easy things are easy, hard things are possible
* Linux provides a large set of simple tools which can be connected with well specified interfaces which are usually textual data streams
* No one big tool is smart enough to handle all cases or optimized for everything or can anticipate all the uses to which it may be put to use.
* It's a big tool box and a lumberyard full of lumber
* Users get a say in what gets built and how it's structured
* We are being groomed to be consumers, resist and become the creators of new things.

### In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
A VPS is a type of website hosting service. It is a contained environment on a server, so it provides almost all of the same possibilities of dedicated hosting at a more affordable price. It is more secure and scaleable than shared hosting allows the user to install any software compatible with the OS it is running.
